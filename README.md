# Projects
A repository for all the projects I decide to make! This is where I plan on placing all my projects that I develop/make in different languages over years, so that I can use it to present myself and my understanding in the languages and the skill with multiple different instances.

This can also be a showcase of how I might have become a better coder/programmer over the years.
